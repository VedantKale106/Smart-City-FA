# Smart City Transit Predictor - My Awesome FA! 🚌 ✨

Yo! 👋 Check out my brain baby - the Smart City Transit Predictor! It's all about gazing into the crystal ball 🔮 and figuring out how many folks will be hopping on the bus. Get ready for some predictive transit magic! 🧙‍♂️

## What's Inside the Box of Wonders 🎁

Here's the sneak peek at the goodies you'll find in this digital treasure chest:

* `app.py`: The heart and soul! ❤️ This is where the Flask party 🎉 never stops. It's the web app that takes your brilliant inputs and spits out demand predictions like a fortune cookie 🥠.
* `dataset_generate.py`: My little data factory! 🏭 This script churns out a synthetic dataset (`pcmctransit.csv`) that's surprisingly realistic (kinda like a movie set, but for data!).
* `pcmctransit.csv`: The star of the show! 🌟 This dataset is the training ground for our prediction guru. It's packed with juicy info on routes, times, days, the weather (because, you know, rain!), events (parades! festivals!), and how many people were on the bus.
* `train_model.py`: The brains of the operation! 🧠 This script takes the `pcmctransit.csv` data and teaches a machine learning model to predict the future! (The model's secret lair is the `model/` directory.)
* `model/`: The top-secret vault 🔒 where the trained model (`demand_classifier.pkl`) and its trusty sidekick label encoder files (`le_*.pkl`) hang out. Shhh! It's classified! 🤫
* `templates/`: The stage! 🎭 This folder holds the HTML script (`index.html`) that makes the web interface look pretty and user-friendly.

## How the Magic Happens ✨

The grand plan is to predict how crowded the buses will be based on a bunch of cool stuff:

* Where the journey begins ➡️ and where it ends ⬅️
* The day of the week (Monday blues? Friday yay!) 🗓️
* The time of day (rush hour madness! 🤪) ⏰
* Temperature (sweaty or sweater weather? 🌡️)
* If there's something exciting happening (like a giant pizza festival! 🍕) 🎉

The `dataset_generate.py` script uses some clever tricks up its sleeve to create a dataset that makes sense. Then, the `train_model.py` script puts on its thinking cap 🤓 and learns from this data. Finally, the `app.py` puts on its showman outfit 🎩 and uses the trained model to give you predictions on a shiny webpage!

## Super Cool Features! 😎

* **Demand Detective:** It can predict if the transit demand will be Low 😴, Medium 🤔, or High 🤯.
* **Map Glimpse:** You get a sneak peek at the route on Google Maps (think of it as a mini-adventure preview! 🗺️). It's not full navigation, but hey, baby steps! 🚶
* **Easy-Peasy Interface:** Even your grandma could use it!👵 Just punch in the info and BAM! Prediction time.

## Let's Get This Show on the Road! 🚀

1. Clone this awesome repo to your local machine.
2. Make sure you've got Python and Flask installed (if not, Google is your friend! 😉).
3. Fire up the web app by running `app.py` in your terminal.
4. Open the web app in your browser and start playing fortune teller! 🔮

## Big High-Five! 🙌

Huge thanks to my awesome buddies who lent a hand or sparked the idea for this project! You guys rock! 🎸
